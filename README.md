####  App Description:

Makani is an Android mobile application that serves disabled people to find the nearest parking spots. The user experience and sensitivity on the topic was taken into consideration while designing. The App has many features including:

    1-	FIND the user’s location and the nearest parking spots available.
    2-	NAVIGATE the users to the spot they choose.
    3-	Allows the user to ADD a parking spot that is not already in the database using crowdsourcing
    4-	Allows the user to DELETE a parking spot that is in the database but does not actually exist in real world using crowdsourcing
    5-	REPORT any misuse or violation by non-disabled people.



#### User Story:

All you need is to install the application on your phone. Running the application will open a splash screen viewing the logo. After few seconds a map of the users location with pins of the nearest locations will appear and an Add a spot button for the user to add a spot to the database that does not exist. Clicking on any pin will lead the user to a page that include the options navigate, delete and report.

Clicking on the navigate button will navigate the user from his position to the parking spots location he chose.

Clicking on the “I can’t find this parking” button will delete the non-existing location from the database.

Clicking on the “Report Violation” button will open the camera for the user to capture the image and put it in the form that includes the location and a comment for submission and adding it to the database. The right authorities to punish violators can use this.


#### Difficulties:
    1-	Connecting the android with the server.
    2-	None of the students in the group has any experience in android development.


####Future Work:

    1-	If the parking spot exist but is occupied by someone then it does not appear in the map.
    2-	Verification for addition or removing of spots.(The spot is not added or deleted except there are a certain number of requests for it.
    3-	A Complain option to request additional handicap parking.
    4-	Review a parking spot (eg. If the spot does not have a pavement ramp)
